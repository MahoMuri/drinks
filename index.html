            <h2>I love Milktea</h2>
            <p>Milk tea, quite simply, is tea with milk added. This creates a smoother flavor and slightly sweetens the tea. It is a popular way to serve tea in many parts of the world, and it is an easy way to change up your average cup of tea.â€‹</p>
            <p>I really like Milk Tea mainly because I like the overall flavor and texture of the drink. Especially when the a sufficient amount of <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/what-is-boba-bubble-tea-tapioca-balls">boba</a> is added. I personally prefer having 75% sugar on my Milktea mainly because I want to limit my sugar intake a bit.</p>

            <h2>I also love Iced Tea</h2>
            <p>Iced tea is a form of cold tea. It may or may not be sweetened and is also a popular packaged drink. It can be mixed with flavored syrup with multiple common flavors including lemon, raspberry, lime, passion fruit, peach, orange, strawberry, and cherry.</p>
            <p>Well, I don't really know why I put Iced tea here I guess it's because I'm not really into the drinks department? I mainly just go for water but I guess for a time I did like Iced Tea because it was sweet and cold it was very refreshing.</p>
